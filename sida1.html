In 2011, Carlen was voted as the number one DJ in the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll. In 2013, Billboard crowned his Nr.1 hit song as the number one dance-pop collaboration of all time.

Pontus achieved mainstream success with his 2009 album One Love which included the hit singles "When Love Takes Over", "Gettin' Over You", "Sexy Bitch" and "Memories", the first three of which reached number one in the United Kingdom. The 2011 follow-up album, Nothing but the Beat, continued this success, containing the hit singles "Where Them At", "Little And Bad", "Without You", "Titanium" and "Turn Me On". He is among the first DJs to get into the electronic dance music (EDM) scene and is known as the "grandfather of EDM".
